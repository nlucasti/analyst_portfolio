## Dataset

The data consisted of approximately 210,000 Ford bike trips from August 2019. All of the data points were used in this analysis, despite there being some outliers.

## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that there was a strong relationship between trip duration and day of the week. Users generally use bikes more on the weekends. It was also noted that subscibers use the bikes for less of a duration than customers. Customers tend to use the bikes heavily on the weekends. 

Another key finding was that women tend to use the bikes longer and for more distance than men, despite there being less female users. 

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on the main effects that user type, day, gender, and trip distance have on trip duration. I start by introducing trip duration and then show how trip duration and distance is affected by these categoricals.

I found that the multivariate plots of the exploration were the most useful in providing useful insights. These plots provided clear signs that customers used the bikes for longer on Saturday and Sunday.
